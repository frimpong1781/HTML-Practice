  	  	<h3>Student Profile</h3>
  	  	Your Student Profile is your link between your life at Carleton and your life after Carleton.  It’s a space that’s open only to members of the Carleton community (students, faculty, staff, and alumni) where you can keep track of your experience and skills, build a professional online presence, and connect with others in the Carleton community who share your interests.
